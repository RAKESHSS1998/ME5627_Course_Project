\chapter*{Abstract}
This project involves the complete design and fabrication of a square cross-section wind tunnel, specifically engineered to create stable and controlled airflow conditions for experimental investigations. The primary focus is on analyzing vortex-shedding phenomena around cylindrical objects to better understand fluid flow behavior. A custom-built hot wire anemometer is employed utilizing a tungsten filament, allowing for precise and reliable data acquisition across different flow velocities. The experimental setup allowed measurements of airflow velocity under various conditions and facilitated the visualization of vortex-shedding using smoke, providing a clear view of the complex flow patterns. The data collected were used to establish the relationship between the Reynolds number ($Re$), which characterizes the flow regime, and the Strouhal number ($St$), which quantifies the frequency of vortex shedding. This analysis revealed significant insights into how variations in flow velocities influence vortex-shedding behavior and how these phenomena can be correlated with fundamental fluid dynamics principles. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of fluid flow dynamics in controlled settings, serving as a foundational framework for future research focused on advanced sensing techniques and simulation models. This helps in further investigation and prediction of the behavior of complex fluid systems.
