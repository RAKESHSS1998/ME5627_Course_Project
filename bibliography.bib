abstract = {Experimental results investigating the vortex shedding behaviour during the interaction of a turbulent wake with a cylinder are presented. The wake was generated by a blunt ellipse and the cylinder placed at various distances behind its trailing edge. When the cylinder was placed greater than three diameters behind the trailing edge, two vortex shedding frequencies were detected in the wake, indicating that tandem bluff bodies need not shed at the same frequency. Further vortex shedding results are presented for the case when the cylinder was placed close to the trailing edge.}

title = {Wall interference effects on hot-wire probes in a nominally two-dimensional highly curved wall jet},
journal = {Journal of Physics E: Scientific Instruments},
abstract = {Hot-wire measurements made with different single-wire probe configurations in a highly curved wall jet showed strong interference effects even on those probes which were optimised in other flow regimes regarding aerodynamic interference. It turned out that a probe with a stem normal to the mean flow indicated values which were too high for the mean velocity and too low for the turbulent fluctuations, i.e. (u'2)12/. The opposite was true for probes with the stem nearly parallel to the mean flow. Both were valid only in the near-wall region y&lt;or approximately=4 mm. In the first case, only the prongs were responsible for the errors, in the second case prongs and stem caused the interference. Quantitatively the effect depended upon the structure of the wall boundary layer. For a specified structure (that means a transitioning boundary layer with turbulent spots) a hot-wire probe was developed which minimised the aerodynamic interference in that given case.}

abstract = {The present paper represents, as far as we are aware, the first linear stability analysis for inertial flows of a viscoelastic fluid around a bluff body. Our particular interest is the effect of polymer additives on the linear stability of two-dimensional viscous flow past a confined cylinder and our investigation involves both direct numerical simulation and the solution of a generalized eigenvalue problem arising from the linearized perturbation equations. For a constant viscosity FENE-type model polymer additive is shown to have a stabilizing effect upon two-dimensional flow past a confined cylinder. In particular, our results reveal that the greater the maximum extensibility of the FENE dumbbells, the larger the value of the critical Reynolds number marking the onset of vortex shedding. Thus the stabilization brought to bear by the presence of the FENE-type dumbbells would appear to depend strongly upon the extensional properties of the polymer solution. This is in agreement with the results of the recent experimental paper of Cressman et al. [J.R. Cressman, Q. Bailey, W.I. Goldburg, Modification of a vortex street by a polymer additive, Phys. Fluids 13 (2001) 867–871] which highlight the importance of the extensional properties of high molecular weight polymers (even at low concentrations) in reducing the kinetic energy contained in the velocity fluctuations behind a cylinder. The impact of elasticity on Strouhal number, time-averaged recirculation length, drag and lift in the vortex-shedding regime are also discussed at some length.}

abstract = {The flow about a circular cylinder placed centrally inside a channel is studied numerically with an unstructured collocated grid finite volume method based on the primitive variable formulation. The distance between the channel walls is allowed to vary to change the blockage ratio. Simulations are carried out over a range of Reynolds numbers that are consistent with the two-dimensional assumption. The study confirms that transition to vortex shedding regime is delayed when the channel walls are close to the cylinder because of the interaction between the vortices from the channel wall and cylinder wake. In the unsteady vortex shedding regime, the wake pattern is opposite to the classic Karman street in respect of the positions of the shed vortices. The cylinder drag coefficient and Strouhal number are considerably increased at smaller gaps while the root-mean-squared lift coefficient is significantly decreased. Several important flow parameters are correlated with the input parameters, namely Reynolds number and blockage ratio.}

abstract = {The present study investigates the flow in a multi-cylinder tandem array. A primary aim is to build a framework for understanding the flow as the number of cylinders becomes large. Two-dimensional numerical simulations have been conducted of the flow past a row of identical and equispaced cylinders, at Reynolds number Re≤200, while the distance between cylinders or pitch varies in the range 1.1≤p≤10. The number of cylinders n in the array varies between n=2 and n=100. Three main regimes are identified as a function of p which are delineated by the behavior of the flow in the gap between the two most upstream cylinders, similar to the regimes in a two-cylinder array. These are a short-pitch or attached regime, with a fully attached and apparently steady flow in this gap, a medium-pitch or fluctuating regime, with some fluctuation in this gap, and a large-pitch or shedding regime, with full vortex formation similar to the wake of single-cylinder system in this gap. Large arrays show that these regimes actually occur as a geometric series, i.e. with progression downstream, the attached regime begins to fluctuate, and then form and shed vortices. This shedding regime is then followed by a region of convective instability which breaks the feedback of information upstream. The flow downstream of this convectively unstable region then goes through the same series of regimes with further downstream progression, but on a longer length scale. There is a self-similar “cascade” – development of fluctuation, established vortex shedding, convectively unstable flow – the self-similar units of which are separated by the regions of convective instability. While the length of each unit is a function of p and Re, the appearance of these units is common.}
